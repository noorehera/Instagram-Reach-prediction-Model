Overview
This project uses Python, data science techniques, and machine learning to analyze and predict Instagram reach based on various post metrics. It provides insights into how impressions, likes, shares, saves, and other factors correlate to engagement, helping users optimize their content for maximum visibility.

Features
Data Analysis:

Visualization of impressions from different sources (home, hashtags, explore, etc.).
WordClouds to analyze frequently used captions and hashtags.
Scatter plots to explore relationships between impressions and engagement metrics like likes, comments, and shares.
Correlation Analysis:

Heatmap of correlations between metrics such as impressions, likes, shares, and profile visits.
Conversion rate calculation to analyze follower growth based on profile visits.
Machine Learning:

Developed a predictive model using the Passive Aggressive Regressor to forecast Instagram post reach based on input features.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
wordcloud
sklearn

Install dependencies using:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly wordcloud scikit-learn

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-reach-prediction.git
cd instagram-reach-prediction
2. Prepare the dataset:
Place the Instagram_dataset.csv file in the project directory. Ensure the dataset contains columns for metrics such as impressions, likes, comments, shares, profile visits, and follows.
3. Run the script:
Execute the Python script to perform analysis and predictions:
bash
python Instagram_Reach_Prediction_Model.py
4. Model Prediction:
Update the features variable with new input data to predict reach:
features = np.array([[Likes, Saves, Comments, Shares, Profile Visits, Follows]])
print(model.predict(features))

Visualizations
Impressions Distribution: Pie chart showing contributions from home, hashtags, explore, and other sources.
Correlation Matrix: Heatmap displaying relationships among metrics.
Scatter Plots: Trends between engagement metrics and total impressions.

Results
Achieved a conversion rate of approximately 41% for profile visits to follows.
Machine learning model achieved a reliable score for predicting Instagram reach.

Future Enhancements
Incorporate more advanced machine learning models.
Add more features like time of posting and content type for better predictions.
Automate data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
